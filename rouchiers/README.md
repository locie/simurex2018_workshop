# Parameter estimation workshops

### author: Simon Rouchier, LOCIE, Universit√© Savoie Mont-Blanc

This folder contains the material for two workshops of the Simurex seminar:
1. Estimation of the heat transfer coefficient by linear regression
2. Calibration of a RC model

Each workshop is available as a Jupyter notebook or as a Python file. You can
download them and run them with your favorite Python IDE. The data files are
are provided in the folder.

Alternatively, you can open the notebooks online in read-only mode with NBviewer:
* [Linear regression](https://github.com/locie/simurex2018_workshop/blob/master/rouchier/Workshop1_linear.ipynb)
* [RC model calibration](https://github.com/locie/simurex2018_workshop/blob/master/rouchier/Workshop2_RCmodel.ipynb)
